<summary> Week 0 - Open-Source tools Installation </summary>
  <br>
  <p> In this phase of the program we focus on establishing a robust and efficient development environment. This was accomplished by installing a suite of essential open-source tools to be used for all subsequent Simulation, Synthesis and Physical design. In order to install the open-source tools, it is required to setup Ubuntu in Orcale Virtualbox.
   <h2>Tool includes:-</h2>

# Yosys-Open Synthesis suite
  Yosys (Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite) is a foundational open-source tool for performing digital hardware synthesis. It translates higher-level hardware description languages (HDL), primarily Verilog, into a lower-level, gate-level netlist.
